###Programming###

Computers are an enigma to many people. Since the dawn of the computer age, mankind has found themselves more able to
calculate the most complex of algorithms and solve the more and more difficult of problems. It is through computers that
we have advanced as much as a society, and because of this the idea of a "programmer" has become more and more valuable.
Computers may seem "magical", but every program that you have ran has been created by some person. Through the art of
programming, talking to and interacting with these machines is possible. So, what is programming exactly? And why should
you learn it?

###What is Programming?###

Programming, by definition, is the action or process of writing computer programs. There are multiple mediums to do this
through. These mediums are something that we call "programming languages". Just as we have languages in order to
communicate with other people, computers have languages in order to allow developer-computer interaction. There are
many of these programming languages, there's Ruby, Python, Java, and hundreds of others.

###What can you do?###

Programmers use these languages in order to interact with computers. By writing lines of code, we are able to create
applications that could, for instance, help keep stock of items in your nearby Krogers or enable transactions. By learning
and understanding the various syntax of these languages, it is possible for you to create these kind of programs with ease,
as well as even more complex ones.

###Why should I do it?###

So, what is the benefit of learning programming? Well, in this informational age, programming is becoming an increasingly
important skill in our daily lives. It is a skill that makes you incredibly hireable as an employee, and it tends to pay
well as well. As an addition to this, the act of programming can be incredibly enjoyable to those that enjoy problem
solving and creating/working on projects. It is a skill that rewards those who enjoy spending there time sitting
down and chugging down cup after cup of coffee while working on a web scraper or a website such as this one.
